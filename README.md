# ⛰️🎿 Mount Stuff - A 2.0 site with REACT

The objective of the project is to make a first creation with REACT. The aim of the project is not to have a complete site, but a vision of what is possible. 

We only have visualization features. If the project would have been in a larger scope, we would have pushed the functionalities to a larger scale, with update, creation as well as deletion of data.
